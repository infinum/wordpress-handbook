# WordPress Handbook

This is a handbook of coding standards and practices for WordPress that we use at Infinum. WordPress has evolved a lot since its beginnings—from a simple blog CMS to a full-fledged CMS used for a wide range of projects: simple websites, online shops, complex multi-site projects communicating with a wide range of APIs.

As the usage of WordPress in our company increased, we thought it would be a good idea to define a set of style guides for the projects we work on. We try to follow the WordPress Coding Standards for the most part, but, being a software development company working on a wide range of projects, we already use certain coding standards that differ from default WordPress Coding Standards.

We'll describe our development process here as well—setting the project locally, versioning practices, using linters, code sniffer, etc.
