# WordPress Handbook

This is a handbook of coding standards and practices for WordPress that we use at Infinum. WordPress has evolved a lot since its beginnings - from a simple blog CMS to a fully fledge CMS used for a wide range of projects: simple web sites, on line shops, complex multi site projects communicating with a wide range of APIs.

With the increased usage of WordPress in our company, we thought that it would be a good idea to define a set of style guides for projects we work on. We try to follow WordPress Coding Standards for the most part but, being a software developing company working on a wide range of projects, we already use a certain coding standards that differ from the default WordPress Coding Standards.
This is especially true for JavaScript as you will see explained in more detail a little later.

We'll describe our development process here as well - setting the project locally, versioning practices, using linters, code sniffer etc.
