        .paragraph__title Introduction
        .paragraph__content WordPress has evolved a lot since its beginningsâ€”from a simple blog CMS to a full-fledged CMS used for a wide range of projects: simple websites, online shops, complex multi-site projects communicating with a wide range of APIs.

We try to follow the WordPress Coding Standards for the most part, but, being a software development company working on a wide range of projects, we already use certain coding standards that differ from default WordPress coding standards.
