In general, we follow the [WordPress PHP Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/) with a few modifications.

To check code automatically, we use [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/), together with our [modified coding standards](https://github.com/infinum/coding-standards-wp).

## Naming

### File naming

File names should be written in lowercase letters with `-` as a separator between words, for example `theme-helpers.php`. In certain cases, such as creating a 'page builder' using ACF, the underscore (`_`) is allowed, but generally you should use the hyphen as a separator.

Files containing a class should be named `class-{classname}.php`. There should always be only one class per file.

Use [wp-boilerplate](https://github.com/infinum/wp-boilerplate) as a basis for any template-based website. You should follow the existing structure of the theme there.

### Naming conventions

Use lowercase letters in variable, action, and function names. Separate words with underscores. Don't abbreviate variable names unnecessarily—let the code be unambiguous and self-documenting.

### Namespacing and class names

Namespacing should follow the file structure. The main namespace is a Capital_Cased version of the project name. So, in the case of boilerplate, the default namespace is

```php
<?php

namespace Inf_Theme;
```

Every folder that holds classes constitutes a subnamespace.

Be aware that WordPress 'lives' in a global namespace. Therefore, when using functions and classes from the WordPress core, it's necessary to either put a slash in front of the class or function name, so that it's called from the global namespace, or use the `use` statement at the top of the file. For example, calling `WP_Query` inside your class should be done like this:

```php
<?php

$query = new \WP_Query( $arguments );
```

And core functions should be used like this:

```php
<?php
\wp_unslash( $_POST['someKey'] );
```

or

```php
<?php
use \WP_Query;

//...

$query = new WP_Query( $arguments );

```

This is especially important if you are writing automated tests.

Avoid using static methods in your classes if possible. Using static methods means that you are calling a function without an instance of the class. But it prevents the usage of many OOP features, such as inheritance, interface implementations, dependency injections, etc. Static methods are useful as helper functions for certain things.

If you are using the same method in many different classes, it's useful to put it in a [Trait](https://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.traits.php).

A Trait is similar to a class, but only intended to group functionality in a fine-grained and consistent way. It is not possible to instantiate a Trait on its own. It is an addition to traditional inheritance and enables horizontal composition of behavior, that is, the application of class members without requiring inheritance.

Class names should use capitalized words separated by underscores.

```php
<?php
class Custom_Class { ... }
```

Constants should be in all uppercase with underscores separating words:

```php
<?php
define( 'IMAGE_URL', get_template_directory_uri() . '/skin/public/images/' );
```

or

```php
<?php
const THEME_VERSION = '1.0.0';
```

### Yoda Conditions

We don't use [Yoda Conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda_conditions), especially since the code checker should make sure that you don't assign a variable in conditionals.

### Functions

When defining a function or a method, there should be no space between the function name and opening parenthesis, but there should be a space between the closing parenthesis and open curly bracket like this:

```php
<?php
function function_name( $var ) { ... }
```

#### Class method visibility

Always add visibility keywords to methods and properties inside classes (`public`, `private` and `protected`).

* `public` scope is used to make that variable/function available from anywhere, other classes and instances of the object.

* `private` scope is used when you want your variable/function to be visible in its own class only.

* `protected` scope is used when you want to make your variable/function visible in all classes that extend the current class, including the parent class.

## Writing style

### Inline statements

Inline statements should have opening and closing PHP tags on the same line

```php
<?php
// Yes:
echo esc_html( $x );

// No:
echo esc_html( $x );
```

Writing conditionals, or control statements on a single line should be done with braces

```php
<?php
if ( $some_variable === true ) { ?>
  <div class="block"></div>
<?php } ?>
```

Never write inline statements without braces. This is an extremely bad practice because it produces code that is hard to read and hard to maintain.

```php
<?php
// Bad code:
if ( $some_variable === true )
  $variable = 'This is inside true statement';

// Worse:
if ( $foo ) bar();

// Good code:
if ( $foo ) {
  bar();
}
```

### Multiple statements

Each multiple statement should be on its own line

```php
<?php
// Yes:
$x++;
echo esc_html( $x );

// No:
$x++; echo esc_html( $x ); ?>
```

### Strict comparison

Always use strict comparison inside conditionals, `in_array()`, `array_search()`, or any PHP function that has the option to check the value and type of the variable.

It's important to use strict comparison because of [type juggling](https://php.net/manual/en/types.comparisons.php).

If you're not sure what kind of value is returned from the WordPress core function, use [WordPress code reference](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/) to check it.

## Type hinting

Type declarations allow functions to require that parameters are of a certain type at call time. If the given value is of the incorrect type, then an error is generated—in PHP 5, this will be a recoverable fatal error, while PHP 7 will throw a `TypeError` exception. But we don't use or encourage using PHP < 7 in our projects.

To specify a type declaration, the type name should be added before the parameter name. The declaration can be made to accept `NULL` values if the default value of the parameter is set to `NULL`.

To enable strict typing in PHP, you need to set a `declare` directive at the top of your file, before the `namespace` definition

```php
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);
```

You can type hint function arguments and return values, for example

```php
<?php
/**
   * Get user data
   *
   * A method that will return an array with user data.
   *
   * @param string $user_token Auth token got from url param.
   *
   * @return array             User data array.
   */
  public function get_user_data( string $user_token ) : array {
    //...
  }
```

When the method can return more than one types (for instance, string or boolean), **don't specify the return type**, as this will most likely throw `TypeError` exceptions (you can read the RFC for `mixed` typehint for version 7.3 [here](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/mixed-typehint)).

From PHP 7.1 you can explicitly declare a variable to be `null`

```php
<?php
public function get_array( ?string $some_string ) : array {
  //...
}
```

Type hinting is also important when working with dependency injections.

```php
<?php
/**
 * Class User credentials
 *
 * Class that stores user credentials.
 */
class User_Credentials {
  /**
   * General Helper object
   *
   * @var string
   *
   * @since 1.0.0
   */
  protected $general_helper;

  /**
   * Initialize class
   *
   * Load helper on class init.
   *
   * @param Helper $general_helper General helper class that implements Helper interface.
   * @since 1.0.0
   */
  public function __construct( Helper $general_helper ) {
    $this->general_helper = $general_helper;
  }

  //...
}
```

## Sanitization and escaping

We follow WordPress [VIP's guidelines](https://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/vip/best-practices/security/validating-sanitizing-escaping/)

1. Never trust user input.
2. Escape as late as possible.
3. Escape everything from untrusted sources (like databases and users), third-parties (like Twitter), etc.
4. Never assume anything.
5. Never trust user input.
6. Sanitation is okay, but validation/rejection is better.
7. Never trust user input.

Every output has to be escaped. Even translatable strings. This means that instead of using `__()` and  `_e()`, we have to use `esc_html__()`, `esc_html_e()`, `esc_attr__()`, `esc_attr_e()`, `wp_kses()`, `wp_kses_post()`, and other escaping functions.

When writing data to the database, be sure to [sanitize](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/theme-security/data-sanitization-escaping/) the variables

`sanitize_text_field( wp_unslash( $_POST['my_data'] ) )`

and to [prepare](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wpdb/prepare/) your database queries.

```php
<?php
$meta = 'Custom meta';

$post_id = 12;

$wpdb->query( $wpdb->prepare( "DELETE FROM $wpdb->postmeta WHERE post_id = %d AND meta_key = %s", $post_id, $meta ) );
```

## Documentation

Every file should have introductory documentation that describes the contents of the file. `functions.php` should have a description block about the theme/project

```php
<?php
/**
 * Theme Name: Project name
 * Description: A short project description
 * Author: Infinum
 * Author URI: https://infinum.co/
 * Version: 0.1.0
 *
 * @package Namespace
 */
```

We follow the [DocBlock](https://phpdoc.org/docs/latest/guides/docblocks.html) format of comments.

Every class should have documentation before it, and the methods inside should also be documented.

```php
<?php
/**
 * Starts the list before the elements are added.
 *
 * @since 3.0.0
 *
 * @see Walker::start_lvl()
 *
 * @param string   $output Passed by reference. Used to append additional content.
 * @param int      $depth  Depth of menu item. Used for padding.
 * @param stdClass $args   An object of wp_nav_menu() arguments.
 */
public function start_lvl( &$output, $depth = 0, $args = array() ) {
  //...
}
```

## Database Queries

Querying the database should be done using a `WP_Query` object. [Don't use query_posts()](https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/a/1755/58895) ever. It can affect other queries on the page because it reassigns the `global wp_query` object.

You can optimize your query by removing unnecessary queries

* `no_found_rows => true`: useful when pagination is not needed (AJAX load).
* `update_post_meta_cache => false`: useful when post meta will not be utilized.
* `update_post_term_cache => false`: useful when taxonomy terms will not be utilized.
* `fields => 'ids`': useful when only the post IDs are needed (less typical).

Never use `posts_per_page => -1`, as this will return every single post in the query, which can have detrimental effects if you have a large number of posts. It's better to set a big number (500 or 1000) as the upper limit.

Direct database calls should be discouraged (`$wpdb`), as well as using `get_posts()`. But use them if you cannot avoid them.

Don't use `post__not_in`. If you need to skip posts, do it in PHP

```php
<?php
$custom_query = new WP_Query( array(
    'post_type' => 'post',
    'posts_per_page' => 30 + count( $posts_to_exclude )
) );

if ( $custom_query->have_posts() ) {
  while ( $custom_query->have_posts() ) {
    $custom_query->the_post();
    if ( in_array( get_the_ID(), $posts_to_exclude ) ) {
      continue;
    }
    the_title();
  }
}
?>
```

Try to avoid post meta queries if possible, that is, don't try to fetch posts by their post meta. Instead, use [taxonomies](https://codex.wordpress.org/Taxonomies) to group posts. Taxonomy queries are fast and won't affect your performance.

On the other hand, fetching post meta if you know the post ID, or if you are in a post/page, is fast and can be used anytime.

```php
<?php
// Don't do this:
$args = array(
    'meta_key'     => 'color',
    'meta_value'   => 'blue',
    'meta_compare' => '!='
);

$query = new WP_Query( $args );

// You can do this:
$color = get_post_meta( get_the_id(), 'color', true );
```

Avoid multi-dimensional queries—post queries based on terms across multiple taxonomies, for instance.

It's better to do a query with the smallest possible number of dimensions, and then filter out the results with PHP.

### Post status security

When setting the `post_status` to anything other than `public` always add `'perm' => 'readable'` argument.
This is due to a possible information disclosure vulnerability which you can read more about here: [WP_Query docs](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_query/#comment-2378).

## Functional programming

Although we cannot write fully functional code because PHP is not a functional programming language, we can use some of the functional techniques while writing our code. This can improve code readability and ease of maintenance.

Functions are first-class citizens in PHP:

```php
<?php
// Function as a variable.
$function_name = function() {
  return 42;
};

// Function as a return type.
function create_function() {
  return function() {
    return 'Return from an anonymous function.';
  };
};

$new_func = create_function();

// Function as a parameter.
function display( $function ) {
  echo $func() , "\n\n";
}

// Call a function by name.
call_user_func_array( 'strtoupper', $some_string );

// objects as functions.
class Some_Class {
  public function __invoke( $param1, $param2 ) {
    [...]
  }
}

$instance = new Some_Class();
$instance( 'First', 'Second' ); // call the __invoke() method
```

Even though looping through iterable objects is generally faster if you use `for` or `foreach`, you can use some functional programming techniques that will make your code a bit less _boilerplatey_. Also, the performance effects are [negligible](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18144782/performance-of-foreach-array-map-with-lambda-and-array-map-with-static-function).

### Mapping

Applying a function to all elements:

```php
<?php
// Old way (imperative):
foreach ( $iterable as $iterable_key => $iterable_value ) {
  $iterable[ $iterable_key ] = strtoupper( $iterable_value );
}

// New way (functional):
$result = array_map( 'strtoupper', $iterable );
```

[array_map manual](https://php.net/manual/en/function.array-map.php)

### Reducing

Reduce an array to a single value:

```php
<?php
// Old way (imperative):
$result = 0;

foreach ( $int_array as $value ) {
  $result += $value;
}

// New way (functional):
$result = array_reduce( $int_array, function( $carry, $item ) { return $carry + $item; }, 0 );
```

[array_reduce manual](https://php.net/manual/en/function.array-reduce.php)

### Filtering

Iterating over an array, but returning only those results that pass some conditions:

[array_filter manual](https://php.net/manual/en/function.array-filter.php)

```php
<?php
// Old way (imperative):
$result = [];

foreach ( $int_array as $value ) {
  if( $value % 2 === 0 ) {
    $result[] = $value;
  }
}

// New way (functional):
$result = array_filter( $int_array, function( $item ) { return ( $item % 2 === 0); } );
```

### Anonymous functions

Using anonymous functions for actions and filters could be problematic because it makes them very hard to unhook later on

```php
<?php
add_action( 'init', function() {
  call_function();
}, 10 );
```

Instead do this:

```php
<?php
add_action( 'init', 'my_callable_function', 10 );

function my_callable_function() {
  call_function();
}
```

If you are working in a 'public' project that can be extended, you should follow the above instruction. In client projects, these are not that important, as you don't expect anybody to remove your added hooks (in themes or in plugins).

### Closures

In JavaScript, a closure can be thought of as a scope. When you define a function, it silently inherits the scope it's defined in, which is called its closure, and it retains that no matter where it's used. It's possible for multiple functions to share the same closure, and they can have access to multiple closures as long as they are within their accessible scope.

In PHP, a closure is a callable class to which you've bound your parameters manually.

It's a slight distinction, but one that bears mentioning.

A Closure is essentially the same as a Lambda, but unlike a Lambda, it can access variables outside the scope that it was created in.

```php
<?php
// Set a multiplier.
 $multiplier = 3;

// Create a list of numbers.
 $numbers = array( 1, 2, 3, 4 );

// Use array_walk to iterate through the list and multiply.
array_walk( $numbers, function( $number ) use ( $multiplier ) {
  echo $number * $multiplier;
} );
```

[Closures in PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/class.closure.php)

### Memoization

Memoization is an optimization technique used to cache function results. If we have a pure function (one that has no side effects), we can cache the result the first time we run it and then just use cache. We can use static variables:

```php
<?php
function factorial( $n ) {
  static $cache = [];

  if ( $n === 1 ) {
    return 1;
  }

  if ( ! array_key_exists( $n, $cache ) ) {
    $cache[ $n ] = $n * factorial( $n - 1 );
  }

  return $cache[ $n ];
}
```

We can generalize this using a helper function:

```php
<?php
function memoize( $func ) {
  return function() use ( $func ) {
    static $cache = [];

    $args = func_get_args();
    $key  = serialize( $args );

    if( ! array_key_exists( $key, $cache ) ) {
      $cache[ $key ] = call_user_func_array( $func, $args );
    }

    return $cache[ $key ];
  }
}
```

and then do:

```php
<?php
$factorial = function( $n ) use( &$factorial ) {
  if( $n === 1 ) {
    return 1
  };

  return $n * $factorial( $n -1 );
}

$mem_factorial = memoize( $factorial );
```

## Optimizations

### Array checking

If possible, avoid using the `in_array()` check because it will traverse the entire array and check if the value of the array is present in the array. Instead, look up by key and use the `isset()` check.

```php
<?php
$array = array(
  'foo' => true,
  'bar' => true,
);

if ( isset( $array['bar'] ) ) {
  // value is present in the array.
};
```

If you have no control over the created array (there are no distinguishable keys to choose from), set the third parameter in the `in_array()` function to `true`. This will force strict comparisons (value and type).

```php
<?php
if ( in_array( 'some value', $array, true ) ) {
  // code goes here.
}
```

### Using array_push() and similar functions

Avoid using `array_push()` when possible. Instead, just append directly to the array

```php
<?php
$my_array = array();

// Good.
foreach ( $other_array as $new_key => $new_value ) {
  $my_array[] = $new_value;
}

// Avoid if possible.
foreach ( $other_array as $new_key => $new_value ) {
  array_push( $my_array, $new_value );
}
```

This will avoid any unnecessary overhead of calling the PHP function, as PHP has to look up the function reference, find its position in memory, and execute whatever code it defines.

### Caching

Use [caching](https://10up.github.io/Engineering-Best-Practices/php/#the-object-cache) to speed up the site.

Use the [`pre_get_posts`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/pre_get_posts/) hook to modify your queries in the back end and in the front end (search queries, etc.).

Use [transients](https://codex.wordpress.org/Transients_API) to further speed up your site.

### I18n

All text strings in a project have to be internationalized using core localization functions. You can check out a great guide to [internalization in WordPress](https://ottopress.com/2012/internationalization-youre-probably-doing-it-wrong/) by Samuel Wood.

### A11y

Accessibility is important. Always follow the official [WordPress a11y guidelines](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/).
