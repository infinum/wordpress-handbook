We use the same rules for writing CSS as defined in the [frontend handbook](https://infinum.com/handbook/frontend/SASS%20Styleguide/File%20organization), just like with JavaScript coding standards.

We use [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) in our projects and [BEM](http://getbem.com/) methodology to write HTML.
