WordPress testing (core) is useful when contributing to the WordPress core. The first thing you have to do is install PHPUnit 7 (8 doesn't work with WordPress yet).

In your terminal, run

```bash
curl https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit.phar -L -o phpunit.phar
chmod +x phpunit.phar
mv phpunit.phar /usr/local/bin/phpunit
```

You can also run

```bash
brew install phpunit
chmod +x phpunit.phar
mv phpunit.phar /usr/local/bin/phpunit
```

Then check the test repository. WordPress tests live in the core development repository, available via SVN at:

```bash
svn co https://develop.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/ wordpress-develop
cd wordpress-develop
```

or Git:

```bash
git clone git://develop.git.wordpress.org/ wordpress-develop
cd wordpress-develop
```

Create an empty MySQL database. Be careful not to use an existing project database, as the test suite will delete all data from the designated database.

Set up a config file. Copy `wp-tests-config-sample.php` to `wp-tests-config.php` and enter the credentials of the newly created database.

### Running the test suite

To run unit tests, you need to specify the `phpunit.xml.dist` file. An example might look like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<phpunit
  bootstrap="tests/bootstrap.php"
  backupGlobals="false"
  colors="true"
  convertErrorsToExceptions="true"
  convertNoticesToExceptions="true"
  convertWarningsToExceptions="true"
  >
  <testsuites>
    <testsuite>
      <directory prefix="test-" suffix=".php">./tests/</directory>
    </testsuite>
  </testsuites>
  <filter>
    <whitelist>
      <directory>./</directory>
      <exclude>
        <directory>./vendor</directory>
        <directory>./tests</directory>
      </exclude>
    </whitelist>
  </filter>
  <logging>
    <log type="coverage-clover" target="tests/_reports/logs/clover.xml"/>
    <log type="coverage-html" target="tests/_reports/coverage" charset="UTF-8" yui="true" highlight="true" lowUpperBound="35" highLowerBound="70" />
    <log type="testdox-text" target="tests/_reports/testdox/executed.txt"/>
    <log type="testdox-html" target="tests/_reports/testdox/testdox.html" />
  </logging>
</phpunit>
```

Here we've specified that code coverage should be created. For that to be done, you need to have Xdebug installed on your system. Keep in mind that Xdebug may significantly reduce the speed of your tests.

In the root directory, where `wp-tests-config.php` file, the `tests/` folder, and the `phpunit.xml.dist` file are located, run:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

Unit test symbol meaning

* . – Each dot signifies one “test” that passed.
* S means a test was skipped. This usually means that the test is only valid in certain configurations, such as when a test requires Multisite.
* F means a test failed. More output on what exactly failed and where will be shown.
* E means a test failed because of a PHP error, warning, or notice.
* I means a test was marked as incomplete.

### Testing inside VVV

VVV comes with a test-ready environment `wordpress-develop/`, where you can test various patches. It already has the test suite set up so you don't need to do anything manually.

Once you are in the `wordpress-develop/public_html/` folder, run

```bash
npm install
```

Then run

```bash
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

After `grunt-cli` has been installed, run

```bash
grunt build
```

If the build fails on the `node-sass` package, try rebuilding it again.

```bash
npm rebuild node-sass
```

**Note**: The build process is currently under revision (https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43055?cversion=0&cnum_hist=23).

### Applying a patch

Make sure that VVV is running and the above steps have been completed. You can then ssh to Vagrant, go to the `wordpress-develop/public_html/` folder and run

```bash
grunt watch &
svn up
```

Now you’re ready to patch. Find a ticket with patches. This example uses `#11863`.

```bash
grunt patch:11863
```

This will show the available patches you can choose from (if there are multiple patches). After you select the patch, you can log into `http://src.wordpress-develop.test/` (or `http://src.wordpress-develop.test/`). You can test the effects of that patch and, after you're done with it, you can revert it using

```bash
svn revert -R
```

or

```bash
svn revert -R --cl revertme .
```

You can comment on the Trac ticket with the findings or create you own patch.

### Testing outside wordpress-develop

You can set up a custom clean installation of WordPress if you don't want to use the official one from VVV.
In that case, just go to public_html and run

```bash
svn co https://develop.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/ .
```

This will download all files that are necessary for testing and patching, as described above.
