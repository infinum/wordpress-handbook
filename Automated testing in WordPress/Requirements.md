In order to set up tests and run code coverage, you need to have certain software on your local Mac.

1. Composer—to download test libraries and PHPUnit
2. Xdebug—to generate code coverage
3. Node.js—if you want to write JS tests for your projects

While Composer and Node should be installed on your computer by now, the Xdebug module is most probably not installed.

## Installing Xdebug

Assuming you have installed the latest stable PHP version using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you should use `pecl` to install the Xdebug. [Pecl](https://pecl.php.net/) is a repository for PHP extensions. First, make sure you have it installed (even though it comes with the Homebrew PHP version).

```bash
which pecl

/usr/local/bin/pecl
```

Try to install xdebug

```bash
pecl install xdebug
```

That can be done in two ways: your installation passes, and you get a message like this

### Successful installation

```bash
...

Build process completed successfully
Installing '/usr/local/Cellar/php/7.3.7/pecl/20180731/xdebug.so'
install ok: channel://pecl.php.net/xdebug-2.7.2
Extension xdebug enabled in php.ini
```

In this case, all you need to check is if PHP has linked the module correctly.

```bash
php -v

PHP 7.3.7 (cli) (built: Aug  5 2019 02:51:04) ( NTS )

```

If you get an error message, you'll need to find your `php.ini` file

```bash
php -i | grep .ini

Configuration File (php.ini) Path => /usr/local/etc/php/7.3

```

Go to `/usr/local/etc/php/7.3/php.ini` and edit it by adding

```bash
zend_extension=/usr/local/Cellar/php/7.3.7/pecl/20180731/xdebug.so
xdebug.remote_autostart=1
xdebug.remote_port=9000
xdebug.remote_enable=1
```

at the end of the `php.ini` file.

That's it, you're ready to go.

### Unsuccessful installation

When installing Xdebug, you might get the following error

```bash
Build process completed successfully
Installing '/usr/local/Cellar/php/7.3.7/pecl/20180731/xdebug.so'

Warning: mkdir(): File exists in System.php on line 294
PHP Warning:  mkdir(): File exists in /usr/local/Cellar/php/7.3.7/share/php/pear/System.php on line 294

ERROR: failed to mkdir /usr/local/Cellar/php/7.3.7/pecl/20180731
```

Go to your php installation folder (`/usr/local/Cellar/php/7.3.7/`, for instance) and type

```bash
ls -all

```

You can see that `pecl` is symlinked to `/usr/local/lib/php/pecl`, but `which pecl` specified `/usr/local/bin/pecl`, which is itself a symlink to `/usr/local/Cellar/php/7.3.7/bin/pecl`. So you need to remove the symlink

```bash
unlink pecl
```
Now you can install Xdebug again, and it should work as described in the previous case (follow the steps described above to add it correctly in your `php.ini`).

## Possible side effects

A possible side effect of running Xdebug, especially if you enable profiler output in Xdebug settings in `php.ini`, is that that file can grow very large. To prevent this, just make sure you delete it every once in a while, or simply don't enable logging.
