## Codeception for WordPress

You can find full installation instructions [here](https://codeception.com/for/wordpress).

First, install the latest stable WPBrowser package via Composer

```bash
composer require lucatume/wp-browser --dev
```

Then, while in the root of your plugin or theme where you've installed the codeception, run

```bash
vendor/bin/codecept init wpbrowser
```

This will set up a scaffolding for setting up various tests in your plugin/theme.
