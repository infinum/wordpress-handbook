## General info

Eightshift Boilerplate is an easy way to kick-start your WordPress development using modern programming practices. We wanted to utilize all the advantages of modern PHP practices, which is why we used namespacing to ensure avoiding any possible class, method, and function clashes in the global namespace. We also implemented an autoloader, which means you no longer have to manually require your classes. Just instantiate them, and the autoloader will take care of the rest. With an added performance boost.

We also used Webpack to bundle all the assets (images, JavaScript, fonts, and Sass files). This will introduce you to the concepts of modern JavaScript development.

Read the readme of the project to learn more about other added bonuses.

This is in-depth documentation on how to run and modify the WordPress boilerplate code. The intended use of this boilerplate is to introduce modern front-end development tools to WordPress.
