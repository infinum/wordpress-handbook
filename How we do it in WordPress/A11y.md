Accessibility is important and should be a part of a regular WordPress development process like responsiveness and performance, etc.

You should always check if:

- Users can navigate using keyboard only
- Users can navigate using VoiceOver
- All necessary images have alt text
- All links have text and are correctly linked
- Check color contrast is sufficient using the [Color Contrast Analyzer](https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/) or [Lighthouse](https://web.dev/learn/#lighthouse).
- Videos have captions
- etc.

For more information, check the official [WordPress a11y guidelines](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/) and Infinum's [Accessibility Handbook](https://infinum.com/handbook/accessibility).
