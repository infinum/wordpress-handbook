Accessibility is important and should be a part of a regular WordPress development process like responsiveness and performance, etc.

You should always check if:

- The user is able to navigate through the website using the keyboard only
- The user is able to navigate using voice over.

For more information, check the official [WordPress a11y guidelines](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/) and Infinum's [Accessibility Handbook](https://infinum.com/handbook/accessibility).
