Gutenberg is a new editor introduced in WordPress version 5.0 that was released in December 2018. It adds content blocks and page builder-like functionality to every up-to-date WordPress website. When in use, it replaces TinyMCE as the default content editor. With Gutenberg, content is added in blocks of various types from the WordPress back end.

You can create blocks that you can preview and live edit from the back end without refreshing the front-end part of the website for every change.
