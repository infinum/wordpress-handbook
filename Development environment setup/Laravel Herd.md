At Infinum we use [Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/) as it provides a simple way to set up a local development environment. Installation on a clean setup is really easy you just [download the installer](https://herd.laravel.com/docs/1/getting-started/installation) and run it. It will install all the necessary software and set up the environment for you.

For more details follow the [official documentation](https://herd.laravel.com/docs/1/getting-started/about-herd).

## Tips and tricks

- Laravel Herd has a Pro version that provides additional features like debugging, profiling, and more. Contact you Team Lead to get more information about it.

- If you used any other setup before you should make sure that you don't have any other services running on the same ports as Laravel Herd. If you do, you should stop them before starting Laravel Herd. Also clean up your Mac before starting Laravel Herd.
