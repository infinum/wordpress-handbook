Setting up MAMP, XAMPP or WAMP is as easy as downloading and installing them.

[MAMP install](https://www.mamp.info/en/)

[XAMPP install](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

[WAMP install](http://www.wampserver.com/en/)

Just follow the instructions and install them.

## Notes

Although here at Infinum you probably won't be running Windows, it doesn't hurt to inform you about some possible issues in case you do.

XAMPP is known to occupy the same port as Skype, so be sure to run XAMPP before you turn on Skype.
