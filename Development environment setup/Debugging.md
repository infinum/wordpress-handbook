## Xdebug

Xdebug is an indispensable tool when working on PHP projects. It's a very powerful debugger which can be used for code coverage when running tests as well.

If you have Laravel Herd Pro installed, [Xdebug](https://herd.laravel.com/docs/macos/debugging/xdebug) is already installed and configured for you.

## Dumps

Laravel Herd Pro provides a simple way to dump your variables and objects. You can use the [Laravel Herd documentation](https://herd.laravel.com/docs/macos/debugging/dumps) to learn more about it.
