Herd ships with PHP extensions to support for all [major databases](https://herd.laravel.com/docs/macos/getting-started/databases), but we can also recommend using Dbngin. It's a simple and lightweight database server for macOS. You can download it from [here](https://dbngin.com/).

After installation you only need to start __mysql__ service.

By default all your databases will be available at `localhost:3306`.

For previewing the databases we recommend using [Sequel Ace](https://sequel-ace.com/), [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) or any other database management tool.
