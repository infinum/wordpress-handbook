> Internationalization is the process of providing multiple language support to software, in this case WordPress. It's often abbreviated as _i18n_, where 18 stands for the number of letters between the first _i_ and the last _n_.

All text strings in a project have to be internationalized using the localization functions from WordPress core. You can also check out this great guide to [internalization in WordPress](http://ottopress.com/2012/internationalization-youre-probably-doing-it-wrong/) by Samuel Wood.
