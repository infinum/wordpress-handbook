> Internationalization is the process to provide multiple language support to software, in this case WordPress. Internationalization is often abbreviated as i18n, where 18 stands for the number of letters between the first i and the last n.

All text strings in a project have to be internationalized using core localization functions. You can also check out this great guide to [internalization in WordPress](ottopress.com/2012/internationalization-youre-probably-doing-it-wrong/) by Samuel Wood.
